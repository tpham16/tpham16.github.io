Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a UC Irvine Alumnus and Data Analyst who transitioned into the field from a non-technical background. I enjoy taking raw data and turning it into meaningful insights and visualizations. I hope to use my skills in data analysis and data visualizations and reports to make better and informed business decisions.
