üì±**Social Media Engagement Analytics, SQL with Python** 

In this project, I worked with 2 classmates on a final capstone project to conduct comprehensive data collection, processing, and analysis of
social media engagement data across Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube for The Knowledge House. 

üõ†Ô∏è**Tools**
* Python
* SQL
* Jupyter Notebook

üí°**Highlights** 
* Posts shared between 6-7 PM (EST) garnered the highest likes. Notabily, engagement trends across all platforms peaked during the months of May, June, and March. 
* On Instagram, carousels or sidecar posts with up to 10 photos or videos emerged as the most engaging content, drawing significant likes and comments.
* High-performing Instagram hashtags included "expand opportunity," "tech," and "Atlanta."
* Top liked YouTube videos featured The Knowledge House 2020 Innovation Fellows, The Knowledge House 2020 Innovation Fellowship, and A Day in The Life: UXUI & Web Development. Shorter videos, under a minute, received the most likes.
* A standout tweet celebrating Kimberly Bryant, the CEO of Black Girls Code, garnered substantial engagement.
* Educational content, particularly focused on expanding opportunities and success stories, resonated strongly across Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.
* User interest was notably high in educational content related to technology, coding, and career development.
* Visual content, including images and videos, consistently attracted more likes, comments, and shares.
* Recommendations include a continued emphasis on sharing educational content through sidecar posts and short-minute videos for sustained engagement.
